 ## Identified best practices for creating passwords:

 Based on the feedback,it can be identified that will work best in case of creating strong passwords;

 1. Use mixed variations in the password i.e. numbers,alphabets( both upper and lower case),symbols; which boosts strength.

 2. Minimum 10-12 characters long.

 3. Avoid using personal information.

 4. Use of uncommon phrases or words.

## Common password attacks:

## Brute force attack: 
A brute force attack is when an attacker tries every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found.
The more character types (uppercase, lowercase, symbols, numbers) and length, the more time it takes.

## Dictionary attack:
A dictionary attack is when an attacker tries passwords from a predefined list of words — usually common or leaked passwords.

Attacker uses a list of common passwords (like "password", "qwerty", "123456").
The list may also include leaked passwords from past data breaches.

## Summarizing how password complexity affects security:

1. More Possible Combinations:
Each added character and character type increases the number of possible combinations an attacker must try.

2. Length Increases Exponentially:
The number of combinations grows exponentially with length.Brute force attackers cannot practically try sextillions of combinations — it would take years or centuries even with powerful computers.

3. Unpredictability Defeats Dictionary Attacks:
Complex passwords like T9g$eL#3nVz@q8B are not found in wordlists.
Dictionary attacks fail when passwords:
Are not real words, Include random characters, Use unusual substitutions.
